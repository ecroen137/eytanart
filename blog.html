                                <h3>Traveling with children on the Autism Spectrum or with other special needs.</h3>
                                <img src="images/Eytan-and-Aviv-300x218.jpg" alt="Eytan and his brother" />
                                <p>
                                    Parents of children on the autism spectrum or with many other special needs, have all experienced the looks and comments from strangers in supermarkets, stores, restaurants or hotels when they see a child behaving in an unusual way and immediately attribute it to poor parenting and/or a spoiled child.  Often children with autism are not easy to identify from their appearance and so their behavior or sounds can take the untrained bystander by surprise.  I personally found that by telling those bystanders that my son has autism, I was able to shift their expression from disapproval to compassion and therefore make myself more comfortable.  Although some children on the spectrum are aware of their own limitations and are bothered by this, my son Eytan couldn’t have cared less what people said about him or how they looked at him – but I did care.  Today when we travel we also pack some of our EytanArt T-shirts (drawn by Eytan) because the designs and messages on them are about respecting differences and we hope they’ll remind people around us to be tolerant and patient.  See the EytanArt designs <a href="index.html">here.</a>
                                </p>
                                <h3>The challenges of traveling with a child who has autism</h3>
                                <img src="images/3penguins300x3392-265x300.jpg" alt="3 penguins" />

                                <p>    
                                    When Eytan was young, our family vacations consisted of going to visit one set of grandparents or the other.  Luckily they both had homes close to beaches and water is always a <em>happy place</em> for Eytan and my other children.  With grandparents there to watch Eytan, my husband and I were able to get out by ourselves or with the other children a few evenings. But other than the trips to grandparents, we found that traveling with our 3 children was challenging.  There were things that Eytan couldn’t tolerate that the rest of us wanted to do.  Restaurants we wanted to eat in where there was nothing he would eat. There were shows or films or museums that we couldn’t see if Eytan was with us because it was hard for him to be quiet for long periods of time.  During most school vacations we stayed home and one parent would take the other children to do fun things while the other parent did activities with Eytan. Although we always managed to have a good time, I still felt badly that we could never take family vacations all together to interesting places.

                                    I recently was introduced to Alan Day, a travel agent and the parent of a child on the autism spectrum.  His child attends the same school that we helped to create when Eytan was young. Because of his own experiences traveling with his child, he realized that there was a need to help families who wanted to take family vacations with their autistic or disabled child.  He combined his many years of experience and connections as a travel agent with his understanding and compassion for the needs that these children and families have, and created a service to help other families. <a href="http://www.asdvacations.com/">http://www.asdvacations.com/</a>

Why can’t a cat play the fiddle and a cow jump over the moon? Why can’t a dog laugh to see such sport and a dish run away with a spoon? When you use your imagination anything is possible. I’d like to share the following story with you and I hope it helps you to <em>imagine if… </em>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Introducing EytanArt’s new design – Hey Diddle Diddle</h3>
                                

                                <p>    
                                    It was my imagination, hope and determination that got me through those early years of not knowing what lay ahead in the future for Eytan. Of course my imagine ifs have changed over the years. They were one thing when he was 2 and newly diagnosed with autism when it felt that the sky was the limit and maybe this would all go away. They then shifted when he was 5 and started kindergarten and there was hope that the new setting and challenges would help him grow even more than he already had. At age 8 a whole world of Imagine ifs opened up when we helped start Giant Steps, a school in Connecticut for children with autism, and Eytan received high quality OT/Sensory Integration, Music Therapy, Speech Therapy, Play Therapy and Daily Living Skills along with his academics.ted from all of these programs with the trip to Israel being the highlight!
                                </p>   
                                   
                                <p>
                                    Our imagine if was shaken when Eytan was in a car accident at age 9 being transported to school and he suffered a severe head injury leaving us with more uncertainty of what the future had in store for him. Each year as Eytan grew, faced new challenges, new settings and new teachers our imaginations of what was possible shifted and grew.
                                </p>
                                <img class="left-img" src="images/EytanArt-200x300.jpg" alt="Eytan" />
                                <p>    
                                    Then one day at a workshop about determining the future for children with special needs after they finish high school, the facilitator asked us an Imagine if question. She asked us if we could imagine our child working in a setting where they get to do the thing that puts the biggest smile on their face. I’ve written about this workshop in more detail before and you can read those articles on this blog. This one question really shifted my Imagine ifs for Eytan and I came out of that workshop with my imagination running wild. I suddenly imagined Eytan using his art and his music skills in a way where he could make an impact on other people with the things he enjoyed doing best. The imagination turned into ideas and plans and strategies and eventually into reality.
                                </p>    

                                <p>
                                    If when Eytan was born, before I knew he had autism, someone had said to me Imagine if your son grows up to be a musician who plays music for young children and the elderly every week bringing them joy and being a role model for many young kids – I would have said FANTASTIC! Or maybe they would have said to me Imagine if your son grows up and creates art that makes people smile, shift their thinking and causes them to be nicer, more respectful and more open to giving to others – I would have said TERRIFIC! Well Eytan, now 26 still has autism, but he is that musician who brings joy and is a role model to others and he is that artist who makes people smile and shifts attitudes in a positive way – and I say FANTASTIC, TERRIFIC!!!

                                    For many years Eytan has benefitted from a program in our community called Friendship Circle. There are other branches of Friendship Circle around the country as well. This program provides volunteers who come weekly to “hangout” with children and teens who have special needs, within the Jewish community. 
                                </p>

                                <p>    
                                    In addition to home visits, they offer holiday programs and bowling programs and for kids over 18 there is even a chance to go on a 10 day group trip to Israel with a supportive staff. Eytan has participated and benefitted from all of these programs with the trip to Israel being the highlight!

                                    And even though he is no longer a teen, Friendship circle continues to include him and provide “friends” for him.

                                <p>    
                                    On the <a href="http://www.friendshipct.com/">Friendship Circle CT website</a> it says: <em>“At the heart of all of the Friendship Circle’s programming is the belief that each and every individual can be a productive member of the community and benefit from the social support offered by one’s peers. Friendship, acceptance and a chance to participate in socially accepted bonding opportunities are critical to achieving this type of inclusive society.” </em>  At EytanArt, we feel in kinship with Friendship Circle which is working towards the same goals that we have, in a very tangible and meaningful way.
                                </p>

                                    EytanArt’s T-shirts and posters all have messages about respecting differences, discovering similarities and making a difference. We hope these designs and messages will help create an atmosphere where every child and adult can be free from bullying and feel respected in their home, school, community, and in the world. Again, we find kinship with Friendship Circle when they state on their website that <em>“We envision a world in which people with special needs and their families experience acceptance, inclusion and friendship as contributing members of society. We foresee a future where they never again have to suffer the social isolation that has often been so prevalent in society.”</em>
                                </p>    
                                <p>
                                    We hope you’ll share information about Friendship Circle with others who could benefit. They truly have a  program that is a great role model for organizations around the country who want to make a difference for children with special needs and their families.

                                    The last time Thanksgiving coincided with the first day of Chanukah was on November 29, 1888.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>    
                                    The next time the two will coincide would be when Thanksgiving falls on Chanukah eve in the year 2070. That would repeat itself in 2165.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>    
                                    So you can see this is an event that only happens once in a lifetime, if at all.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was worth having Eytan draw a picture to commemorate this event.  I asked him one day to draw a turkey menorah – also being called a Menorkey.  He went up to his room and came down a while later with this fun drawing.  We’re hanging it up at our Thankgivingkah dinner.   Feel free to share this drawing with others who may be celebrating Chanukah on Thanksgiving this year.
                                </p>
